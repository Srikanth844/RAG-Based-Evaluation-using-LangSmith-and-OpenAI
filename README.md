# RAG-Based Evaluation Bot using LangSmith and OpenAI

This repository provides a framework for building and evaluating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using LangSmith and OpenAI's GPT-4. The bot leverages a custom retriever, integrates with LangChain for evaluation, and evaluates performance using multiple metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` package manager
- LangSmith library
- OpenAI library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API keys:
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key and set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
   - Ensure your LangSmith API key is set up correctly by following the LangSmith documentation.

## Code Overview

### Main Components:

1. **VectorStoreRetriever**: This class handles the retrieval of relevant documents from a set of documents based on a query. It uses OpenAI's embeddings to generate vector representations of the documents and query, which are then compared using cosine similarity.

2. **NaiveRagBot**: This class implements the RAG model using the `VectorStoreRetriever`. It sends relevant documents to OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate an answer based on the context retrieved.

3. **Evaluation**: The evaluation step uses multiple metrics to assess the generated answers, including:
   - **Answer Correctness**
   - **Answer Relevancy**
   - **Context Precision**
   - **Context Recall**
   - **Faithfulness**

4. **Integration with LangSmith**: LangSmith is used to track runs, evaluate performance, and store dataset results.

### Key Functions:

- `VectorStoreRetriever.from_docs()`: Loads documents and generates embeddings for them using OpenAI's embeddings API.
- `NaiveRagBot.get_answer()`: Uses the retriever to get relevant documents and then generates an answer from GPT-4.
- `RunEvalConfig`: Configures custom evaluators (metrics) for the LangSmith evaluation process.

## How to Run

To run the bot and perform evaluation, follow these steps:

1. **Set up your environment**:
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` environment variables.

2. **Execute the script**:
   - Run the following command to start the bot and evaluation process.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The generated answer preview will be printed to the console.
   - Evaluation results will be printed as a JSON object, showing the evaluation scores based on the configured metrics.

## Example Output

```bash
Generated Answer: You get 15 days off annually.
Evaluation Results:
{
  "evaluation_scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.9,
    "answer_relevancy": 0.85,
    "context_precision": 0.8,
    "context_recall": 0.75,
    "faithfulness": 0.95
  }
}
```
